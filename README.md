## Exchange
This is my first project and I started it for practicing my knowledge in Back-End programming,
Restful applications, Flask API, Orator and databases. My interests are generally in the fields of finance and programming, thus this project also
helped me deepen my knowledge in them.

This is a model of an exchange of assets that deals with general problems of trading stocks. It could be upgraded by further
 implement a Front-End application.
